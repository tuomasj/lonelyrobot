# Lonelyrobot

Barely working demo is playable [here](http://tuom.as/games/lonelyrobot).

You are a tiny lonely robot, mining the forgotten mines in asteroid between Earth and Mars.
The humans have left the mines empty, but the mines have enough minerals to send automatic mining robots to scrape the leftovers.

If a robot finds something, it's a bonus. If it doesn't, the robot will be left there...
