Lonelyrobot
===========

You are a tiny lonely robot, which is tirelessly mining the forgotten mines in asteroid between Earth and Mars.
The humans have left the mines empty, but inside the mines are still enough minerals to send automatic mining robots.

If they find something, it's a bonus. If they don't, they will be left there...
